PROJECTIONS AND 3-D TRANFORMATION

1. I have taken all inputs from projections' respective files, because entering 3-D coordinates of 
figures at runtime is difficult.
The Inputs can be changed in the respective files to check for multiple figures

2. I have included translation factor funtionality in the code using shiftV function,
if the projected figure is not easily visible the "0 0 0" line in their respective files
can be changed to add some translation factor for better viewing if required

3. Only the "projectionDriver.py" program needs to be run, all others are imported in it 

4. To run use: python3 projectionDriver.py
because the codes are written in python3 

5. The documention/comments for explaination is done in respective files for projections

6. All the edges are colored differently for easy viewing of the projected figures,I have added 
max 16 colors for an object of upto  16 edges, more colors can be easily added to "drawFigure(no,v1,v2,win)"
to colors list, if a figure having more than 16 edges is entered. 
Even if new colors not added for  figures with more than 16 edges,
the program will not crash, there will just be repeated colors for few edges.

7. The "transform3D.py" file is separate program for translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, etc
for 3-D figures.

8. While entering new coordinates in input files, two vertices in each line should be entered as figure is
being drawn by drawing adjacent edge vertices.
The first line of each file must be the no of edges in the figure.


THANK YOU :)
